## Public Library

With dbd.ts it allows custom plugins to be made and shared across with ease.

Though with a new feature established you can install plugins with a simple export of plugin and it auto installs for you.

## Adding your own Plugins to the Library
With precaution from malicious intentions, only the developers of dbd.ts will be accepting / denying any Pull Requests or changes to plugins.
